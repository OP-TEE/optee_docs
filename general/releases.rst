Long version
============

    1. Create a "release pull request" at GitHub ought to collect ``Tested-By``
       tags from various maintainers. As an example, see `PR#3099`_.

    2. Send email to all maintainers to let them know about the upcoming
       release. The addresses to the maintainers can be found in the
       MAINTAINERS_ file.

       .. hint::
            With this command you will get all email addresses

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ scripts/get_maintainer.py --release-to

    3. Increment the revision number in `mk/config.mk`:
       ``CFG_OPTEE_REVISION_MAJOR`` and ``CFG_OPTEE_REVISION_MINOR``. These
       values are made available to TAs and to the Normal World driver at boot
       time.

    4. Create a release candidate (RC) tag (annotated tag, i.e., ``git tag -a
       3.x.y-rc1 -m "3.x.y-rc1"``) in the following gits
       ``optee_*`` and ``build.git``. One way to do it is like this

       .. code-block:: bash

            $ export VER=3.x.y-rc1
            $ for d in optee* build; do ( cd $d; git tag -a $VER -m $VER ); done
            $ for d in optee* build; do ( cd $d; git push origin $VER ); done


    5. Send a follow up email to all maintainers to let them know that there is
       a release tag ready to be tested on their devices for the platforms that
       they are maintaining.

    6. In case major regressions are found, then fix those and create a another
       release candidate tag (i.e., repeat step 3 and 4 until there are no
       remaining issues left).

    7. On release day: Update CHANGELOG.md_ see this `changelog example`_ to see
       how that should look like.

    8. Collect all tags (``Tested-By`` etc) from maintainers and use those in
       the commit message, for an example see this `commit example`_.

    9. Create a release tag (annotated tag, i.e., ``git tag -a 3.x.y -m
       "3.x.y"``) in the following gits ``optee_*`` and ``build.git``. Tag the
       tip of the ``optee`` branch in ``linux.git``, the name of the tag has
       to be prefixed with ``optee-`` to avoid confusions. For instance:
       ``git tag -a optee-3.x.y -m "optee-3.x.y"``.

       .. hint::

            You can use the same steps as in step 4, when creating the tags.

    10. Create a new branch in :ref:`manifest` from ``master`` where the name
        corresponds to the release you are preparing. I.e., ``git checkout -b
        3.x.y origin/master``.


    11. Update all :ref:`manifest` XML-files in the :ref:`manifest` git, so they
        refer to the tag in the release we are working with (see `3.6.0 stable`_
        commit as an example). This can be done with the make_stable.sh_ script.
        Now it is also time to push the new branch and tag it. Example:

       .. code-block:: bash

            $ export VER=3.x.y
            $ cd manifest
            $ ./make_stable.sh -o -r $VER
            $ git diff  # make sure everything looks good
            $ git commit -a -m "OP-TEE $VER stable"
            $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:OP-TEE/manifest
            $ git push upstream
            $ git tag -a $VER -m $VER
            $ git push upstream tag $VER

    12. Send a last email to maintainers and other stakeholders telling that the
        release has been completed.
