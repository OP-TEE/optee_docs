On this page you will find device specific information for QEMU v7 (Armv7-A) and
QEMU v8 (Armv8-A).

.. _qemu_v7:

#######
QEMU v7
#######
The instructions here will tell how to run OP-TEE using QEMU for Armv7-A.

Build instructions
******************
As long as you pick the v7 manifest, i.e.,  ``default.xml`` the
":ref:`get_and_build_the_solution`" tells all you need to know to build and boot
up QEMU v7.

A usual short shell sequence to fetch, build and run OP-TEE using QEMU
for Armv7-A is like the one below:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mkdir optee
  $ cd optee
  $ repo init -u https://github.com/OP-TEE/manifest.git
  $ repo sync
  $ cd build
  $ make toolchains
  $ make run

.. hint::

    If you do not want to check out the latest version of OP-TEE, but rather a
    specific tagged version, you can use ``repo init -u
    https://github.com/OP-TEE/manifest.git -b <branchname>``. e.g., ``repo init
    -u https://github.com/OP-TEE/manifest.git -b 3.16.0``. You can see valid
    branch names by inspecting the OP-TEE/manifest git repository on
    https://github.com/OP-TEE/manifest/branches.

    To speed up your build, you can make use of the parallel make feature. For
    example, use ``make -j32 run`` to have 32 build processes running
    concurrently. Note that this will make it much more difficult to spot
    errors if something fails; therefore fall back to sequential builds to view
    build errors and produce logs for bug reports.

Consoles
********
After running ``make run`` you will end up in the QEMU console and it will also
spawn two UART consoles. One console containing the UART for secure world and
one console containing the UART for normal world. You will see that it stops
waiting for input on the QEMU console. To continue, do:

.. code-block:: none

    (qemu) c

Host-Guest folder sharing
*************************
You can use the VirtFS QEMU feature to avoid changing rootfs CPIO archive every
time you need to add additional files or modify existing files. To do this, you
share a folder between the guest and host operating systems. To enable and use
this feature you have to provide additional arguments when running make,
example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make QEMU_VIRTFS_ENABLE=y QEMU_USERNET_ENABLE=y

.. hint::

    You can also add ``QEMU_VIRTFS_HOST_DIR=<share>`` in case you don't want to
    use the default sharing location (which is the root of <qemu-v7-project>).

When QEMU with OP-TEE is up and running, you can mount the host folder in QEMU
(normal world UART).

.. code-block:: none

    # mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio host <mount_point>

``<mount_point>`` here is folder in the QEMU where you want to mount the host
PC's shared folder. So if you want to mount it at ``/mnt/host`` you typically do
this from QEMU NW/UART.

.. code-block:: none

    # mkdir -p /mnt/host
    # mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio host /mnt/host

Networking
**********
After booting QEMU, ``eth0`` will automatically receive an IP address from
QEMU via DHCP using the SLiRP user networking feature. QEMU will act as a
gateway to the host network `SLiRP`_.

Please note that ICMP won't work in the guest unless additional configuration is
made, so the ``ping`` utility won't work.

GDB - Normal world
******************
If you need to debug a client application, using GDB in a remote debugging
configuration may be useful. Remote debugging means ``gdb`` runs on your PC,
where it can access the source code, while the program being debugged runs on
the remote system (in this case, in the QEMU environment in normal world). Here
is how to do that. On your PC, build with ``GDBSERVER=y``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd <qemu-v7-project>/build
    # You **only** need to rm -rf the first time you build with the new flag.
    # If you omit doing so, it's likely that you will see "stamp" errors in the
    # build log.
    $ rm -rf <qemu-v7-project>/out-br
    $ make -j8 run GDBSERVER=y

Boot up as usual

.. code-block:: bash

        (qemu) c

Inside QEMU (Normal World UART), run your application with gdbserver (for
example ``xtest 4002``):

.. code-block:: none

    # gdbserver :12345 xtest 4002
    Process xtest created; pid = 654
    Listening on port 12345

Back on your PC, open another terminal, start GDB and connect to the target:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ <qemu-v7-project>/out-br/host/bin/arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf-gdb
    (gdb) set sysroot <qemu-v7-project>/out-br/host/arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf/sysroot
    (gdb) target remote :12345

Now GDB is connected to the remote application. You may use GDB normally.

.. code-block:: none

    (gdb) b main
    (gdb) c

GDB - Secure world
******************
TEE core debugging
==================
To debug TEE core running QEMU with GDB, you need to disable TEE ASLR with
``CFG_CORE_ASLR=n`` flag. Furthermore, note that it's easier to debug if you
have optimization disabled. Other than that you will have four consoles that
you are working with.

    - Qemu console
    - NW UART console
    - SW UART console
    - GDB console

All of them but the GDB console are consoles you normally will see/use when
running OP-TEE/xtest using QEMU. The first thing is to start QEMU, i.e.,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd <qemu-v7-project>/build
    # make run-only also works if you don't want to rebuild things
    $ make run CFG_CORE_ASLR=n

Next launch another console for GDB and do this

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd <qemu-v7-project>/toolchains/aarch32/bin
    $ ./arm-linux-gnueabihf-gdb -q

In the GDB console connect to the QEMU GDB server, like this (the output is
included to show what you normally will see).

.. code-block:: none

    (gdb) target remote localhost:1234
    Remote debugging using localhost:1234
    warning: No executable has been specified and target does not support
    determining executable automatically.  Try using the "file" command.
    0x00000000 in ?? ()

Still in the GDB console, load the symbols for TEE core

.. code-block:: none

    (gdb) symbol-file <qemu-v7-project>/optee_os/out/arm/core/tee.elf
    Reading symbols from <qemu-v7-project>/optee_os/out/arm/core/tee.elf...done.

Now you can set a breakpoint for any symbol in OP-TEE, for example

.. code-block:: none

    (gdb) b tee_entry_std
    Breakpoint 1 at 0xe103012: file core/arch/arm/tee/entry_std.c, line 526.

Last step is to initiate the boot, do that also from the GDB console

.. code-block:: none

    (gdb) c
    Continuing.

At this point will see UART output in the Normal world console as well as the
Secure world UART console. If you now for example :ref:`optee_test_run_xtest`,
then you will rather soon hit the breakpoint we previously set and you will see
something like this in the GDB console:

.. code-block:: none

    Continuing.
    [Switching to Thread 2]

    Thread 2 hit Breakpoint 1, tee_entry_std (smc_args=0xe183f18
    <stack_thread+8216>) at core/arch/arm/tee/entry_std.c:526
    526             struct optee_msg_arg *arg = NULL;       /* fix gcc warning */
    (gdb)

From here you can start to poke around with GDB, single step, read memory, read
registers, print variables and all sorts of things that you normally do with a
debugger.

.. hint::

    Some people find it easier to also see the source code while debugging. You
    can enable the "TUI mode" to see the source code in GDB. To enable that, run
    GDB with

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ ./arm-linux-gnueabihf-gdb -q -tui

.. _qemu_v8:

#######
QEMU v8
#######
The instructions here will tell how to run OP-TEE using QEMU for Armv8-A.

Build instructions
******************
As long as you pick the v8 manifest, i.e.,  ``qemu_v8.xml`` the
":ref:`get_and_build_the_solution`" tells all you need to know to build and boot
up QEMU v8.

A usual short shell sequence to fetch, build and run OP-TEE using QEMU
for Armv8-A is like the one below:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mkdir optee
  $ cd optee
  $ repo init -u https://github.com/OP-TEE/manifest.git -m qemu_v8.xml
  $ repo sync
  $ cd build
  $ make toolchains
  $ make run

All other things (networking, GDB etc) in the v7 section above is also
applicable on QEMU v8 as long as you replace ``<qemu-v7-project>`` with
``<qemu-v8-project>`` to get the correct paths relative to your QEMU v8 setup.
