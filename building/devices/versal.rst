AMD-Xilinx Versal ACAP VCK190
#############################
Instructions below show how to run OP-TEE on the `VCK190`_ development board.
Details of the Versal ACAP can be found in the Versal Technical Reference Manual
(`Versal_TRM`_).

Supported boards
****************
This makefile supports the VCK190 but also supports the `VMK180`_ development
board as well.

Setting up the toolchain
************************
This build chain relies on Petalinux 2022.1, therefore the first step will be to
download and `install`_ it from the AMD-Xilinx website (`Downloads`_).

Then, you will also need to download the board support package (BSP) from the
AMD-Xilinx website (`Downloads`_). It contains prebuilt firmwares and hardware
definition files required to assemble a bootable image.

.. note::
   You will need a free AMD-Xilinx account to proceed with the two previous
   steps.

Configuring and building for VCK190
***********************************
Lets summarize the steps taken so far; these are common to all boards.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ mkdir ~/optee-project
	$ cd ~/optee-project
	$ repo init -u https://github.com/OP-TEE/manifest.git -m versal.xml
	$ repo sync -j4 --no-clone-bundle
	$ cd build
	$ make -j8 toolchains
	$ make -j8

At this point we have a working directory ``~/optee-project`` with all the
repositories required with the exception of the Versal ACAP board support
package. A pre-requisite to unpacking the BSP file is installing Petalinux
(`install`_) as previously mentioned.

Having done that, now is the time to unpack the BSP:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ cd ~/optee-project
	$ cp ~/Downloads/xilinx-vck190-v2022.1-04191534.bsp .
	$ source /path/to/petalinux.2022.1/settings.sh
	$ petalinux-create --type project -s xilinx-vck190-v2022.1-04191534.bsp
	$ ls
	   xilinx-vck190-2022.1

.. note::
   Replace the VCK190 BSP with the VMK180 BSP if you want to build this project
   for the VMK180 development board.

Before building the release, you will need to edit the Boot Image File (BIF)
``build/versal/bootImage-versal-vck190.bif`` to point to the required BSP files.
The paths for the following files in the BIF will need to be updated *before*
proceeding:

- vpl_gen_fixed.pdi
- plm.elf
- psmfw.elf

.. note::
   The default PLM **only** contains the xilsecure library. If you would like to
   take advantage of all of hardware cryptographic features implemented for
   Versal, you **must** enable the xilpuf and xilnvm libraries by following the
   steps for customizing the PLM found here (`PLM_Customization`_).

The xilpuf library enables support of the physically unclonable function (PUF)
and the xilnvm library enables support of reading and writing to eFUSEs. Once
these libraries are enabled, be sure to point to the updated PLM firmware in the
previously mentioned BIF file.

After you have done that you can build the images as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ cd ~/optee-project
	$ cd build
	$ make -f versal.mk image
	$ ls versal | grep -E 'BIN|ub'
	  BOOT.BIN
	  versal-vck190.ub


JTAG boot to U-Boot shell
*************************
To run the bootable image ``BOOT.BIN`` via JTAG, configure the boot switches as
seen below and then power up the board.

.. figure:: /images/boards/vck190-jtag-boot.png
	:width: 400
	:align: center

Then run the boot_jtag.sh script.

This script will first ask for the path of the Petalinux installation; once
entered, it will download and execute the image on the Versal ACAP platform.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ cd ~/optee-project/build/versal/
	$ ./boot_jtag.sh



SD card creation and boot
*************************
Prepare a SD card with a single **bootable** partition large enough to hold both
of the built files.

Using ``gparted`` or any other partition manager tool create a single partition
on the card (remember to flag it as bootable)

	* 1GB FAT32 bootable partition (i.e: ``/dev/sdc1``).

Once SD card is partitioned, mount it on your file system and copy the images:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ cp ~/optee-project/build/versal/BOOT.BIN <mount_point>/
	$ cp ~/optee-project/build/versal/versal-vck190.ub <mount_point>/
	$ sync
	$ umount <mount_point>

Now you can use the newly created SD card to boot your board. Make sure the boot
switches are configured for SD boot.

.. figure:: /images/boards/vck190-sd-boot.png
	:width: 400
	:align: center

Unless you have modified the default U-boot boot command, you will need to stop
the sequence at the U-boot shell and issue these three additional commands to
boot to Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

	uboot shell$ mmc dev 0
	uboot shell$ fatload mmc 0:1 0x20000000 versal-vck190.ub
	uboot shell$ bootm 0x20000000
