Build and run
#############

In this part of the documentation you will find information telling you how to
build OP-TEE as a whole developer setup or as individual components. Likewise it
will also tell you how to run OP-TEE on various devices.

Since you pressed this, it's likely that you want to know how to build a full
OP-TEE developer setup. So a first place to start looking is probably at the
":ref:`build`" page to get started.
