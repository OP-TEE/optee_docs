We believe that you can use any Linux distribution to build OP-TEE, but as
maintainers of OP-TEE we are mainly using Ubuntu-based distributions and to be
able to build and run OP-TEE there are a few packages that needs to be
available.

        .. note::

            No longer supported by the OP-TEE community!

        Due to all changes over the years with different names of Python
        packages and different requirement in time for Python2 and/or Python3
        packages, it's not really possible to build more recent versions of
        OP-TEE with something that is older than Ubuntu 18.04. If you for some
        reason need to rebuild OP-TEE using a very old distro, then the best
        strategy for doing is is to check an earlier version of this
        documentation and start with the build instructions from there.
